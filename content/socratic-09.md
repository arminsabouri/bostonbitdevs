Housekeeping and Welcome!

It's been over 2.5 years since the last Boston BitDevs meetup. We've got a lot of ground to make up for! 

You may be wondering where the reading lists for Socratic Seminars 1-8 are. Those can be found in the [Past Events](https://www.meetup.com/boston-bitdevs/events/past/) section of the Meetup page.
